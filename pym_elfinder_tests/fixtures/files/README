These are file fixtures.

elFinder from within the unit tests gets initialized with these.

In the PHP sources of elFinder
(https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/tree/2.x/php), initialize elFinder with
this directory to obtain the canonical responses.

ATTENTION: If you run elFinder's PHP over these file fixtures, it will create
hidden directories ".quarantine" and ".tmb". Both are not yet implemented in
our Finder, so you have to remove them, otherwise any commands that produce
item listings, like "open init", will fail.
